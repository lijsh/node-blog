Only finish restful api by far.

### someting I learn during building this stuff
1. how to create a connect pool using mongodb? use mongoclient instead of generic pool. https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/driver-articles/mongoclient.html#mongoclient-connection-pooling
2. Is there Anything must-have tools during node programming? A tool make server auto-restart after file modified(like [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/)) and debugging tools(I use [node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector))
3. express's minimalist make it shine for Front-End Engeener to construct a mock server.

### Todo
